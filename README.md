# Basic Selenium Tests
Basic Selenium tests practice to get familiar with writing Selenium tests. This is
my first example with Selenium and does not include Page Objects. I wrote two basic 
tets here, one that goes into a webpage and checks for a header, and the other test 
goes to the default Google webpage and gets the title to test if the title is 'Google'.
